- if a user has added an item in its cart but is bought by someone(i.e. transaction has completed), then the item will be removed from the search items page and also from the carts of users who have added those items.

- if seller has received multiple orders from different buyers for an item and he completes transaction for any one user, then the item will disappear from other user's pending orders tab in 'Orders History' Page. They will also disappear from orders left to be delivered on 'Deliver Items' Page of the seller as he had only one item and can sell only to one user.
